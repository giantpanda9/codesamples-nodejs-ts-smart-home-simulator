Node.js and Golang binary Smart Home Dev Simulator
# Installation
1) git clone git clone https://github.com/giantpanda9/codesamples-nodejs-ts-smart-home-simulator
2) cd codesamples-nodejs-ts-smart-home-simulator
3) npm install
4) npm run start
5) the repository should already include the Golang smart device binary located in /bios/goSmart in both /dist and /src folders, however, if you wish to see the source code of the Golang part or rebuild it for your Linux, please see the corresponding repository
6) At the moment Golang binary is already included inthis package so you need not to build it yourself, the Node.js part will automaically run the Golang binary and start talking to it, so just run npm install -> npm run start, like suggested in points 1-4 and that should be it.
